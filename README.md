## Getting Started
1.  First of all you need to clone CoronaTime repository from github:
```
git clone https://github.com/RedberryInternship/nugzar-rostiashvili-corona-time.git
```
2. Next step requires you to run composer install in order to install all the dependencies.
```
composer install
```
3. after you have installed all the PHP dependencies, it's time to install all the JS dependencies:
```
npm install
```
and also: 
```
npm run dev
```
4. Now we need to set our env file. Go to the root of your project and execute this command.
```
cp .env.example .env
```
And now you should provide .env file all the necessary environment variables:

MYSQL:
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
```

```
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
```

```
DB_PORT=3306
```

```
DB_DATABASE=*****
```

```
DB_USERNAME=*****
```

```
DB_PASSWORD=*****
```
5. Now execute in the root of you project following:
```
  php artisan key:generate
```
Which generates auth key.
Now, you should be good to go!
## Migration

```
php artisan migrate
